# Week in review

`bind` function is my one of my new favorite things in javascript. It basically allows currying by providing part of a parameter list and returning a function that takes the rest of the parameters. It even works on generator functions. Generator functions are also way better than promises due to not having any callbacks and the easy of constructing complex asynchronous behaviour such as paging. I also learned that you can also create anonymous generator functions just like regular ones:

``` javascript
export function * fetchWithPagingGenerator (action, failureType) {
  yield* pagingGenerator(
    action,
    failureType,
    function * (nextPage) {
      ...
    }
  )
}
```

I am feature complete on the domain layer for the first cut. There are some minor things that I might do later such as adding authenticating to xbox live once someone is logged in to windows live, and a better way to handle paging.

Next week I need to figure out authentication to xbox live using Oauth 2. I have put this off for long enough.
